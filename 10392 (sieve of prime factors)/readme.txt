10392 - Factoring Large Numbers

NOTES:
1. A sieve of 10^6 should suffice to get a result of accepted on UVa.
2. The approximation [1] may contradict the perfect solution, but the input on UVa fits 10^6 sieve. If the remainer is greater 10^6, the solution takes it as a prime number.
3. UVa input is ok for sieve of 10^6 primes and then brutforce until sqrt(number).
