Miusov, as a man man of breeding and deilcacy, could not but feel some inwrd qualms, when he reached the Father Superior's with Ivan: he felt ashamed of havin lost his temper.
He felt that he ought to have disdaimed that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima's cell, and so to have forgotten himself.
"Teh monks were not to blame, in any case," he reflceted, on the steps.
"And if they're decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous withthem?
He determined to drop his litigation with the monastry, and relinguish his claims to the wood-cuting and fishery rihgts at once.
He was the more ready to do this becuase the rights had becom much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in quedtion were.
But tehre was was no great luxury about the furnishng of these rooms eithar.
There was no vodka.
Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing.
He had a footting everywhere, and got informaiton about everything.
He was of an uneasy and envious temper.
He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit.
Neither Alyosha nor anyone else could have infleunced him in that.
Rakitin, of course, was a person of tooo little consecuense to be invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Paissy, and one othr monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited.
They were alraedy waiting when Miusov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived.
The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also.
The Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests.
He was a tall, thin, but still vigorous old man, with black hair streakd with grey, and a long, grave, ascetic face.
He bowed to his guests in silence.
But this time they approaced to receive his blessing.
Miusov even tried to kiss his hand, but the Father Superior drew it back in time to aboid the salute.
But Ivan and Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner, kissing his hand as peesants do.
"We must apologize most humbly, your reverance," began Miusov, simpering affably, and speakin in a dignified and respecful tone.
"Pardonus for having come alone without the genttleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch.
He felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitalty, and not wihtout reason.
In the reverand Father Zossima's cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissention with his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping...
in fact, quite unseamly...
as" -- he glanced at the monks -- "your reverance is, no doubt, already aware.
And therefore, recognising that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his apologees and regrets.
In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends later.
He asks your blessinq, and begs you to forget what has takn place."
As he utterred the last word of his terade, Miusov completely recovered his self-complecency, and all fist in a paroxysm of simulated feelling.
"This monastery has played a great part in my life!
It has cost me many bitter tears.
You used to set my wife, the crazy one, against me.
You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me all over the place.
Enough, fathers!
This is the age of Liberalizm, the age of steamers and reilways.
Neither a thousand, nor a hundred ruobles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!"

It must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part in his liffe, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it.
But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one momant allmost beliefing it himself.
He was so touched he was almost weeping.
But at that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw back.

The Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again spoke impressively:

"It is writen again, 'Bear circumspecly and gladly dishonor that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him who hath dishonored thee.' And so will we."

"Tut, tut, tut!
Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole.
Bethink yourselfs Fathers, I will go.
But I will take my son, Alexey, away from here for ever, on my parental authority.
Ivan Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me.
Von Sohn, what have you to stay for?
Come and see me now in the town.
It is fun there.
It is only one short verst; instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha.
We will have dinner with some brendy and liqueur to it....
I've cloudberry wyne.
Hey, von Sohn, don't lose your chance." He went out, shuoting and gesticulating.
It was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.
"Alexey!" his father shouted, from far off, cacthing sight of him.
"You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pilow and matress, and leeve no trace behind."
Alyosha stood rooted to the spot, wacthing the scene in silense.
Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriege, and Ivan was about to follow him in grim silance without even turnin to say good-bye to Alyosha.
But at this point another allmost incrediple scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishng touch to the episode.
Maximov suddenly appeered by the side of the carriage.
He ran up, panting, afraid of being too late.
Rakitin and Alyosha saw him runing.
He was in such a hurry that in his impatiense he put his foot on the step on which Ivan's left foot was still resting, and clucthing the carriage he kept tryng to jump in.
"I am going with you!
" he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthfull laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face.
"There!" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delihted.
"Did I not say he waz von Sohn.
It iz von Sohn himself, risen from the dead.
Why, how did you tear yourself away?
What did you von Sohn there?
And how could you get away from the dinner?
You must be a brazen-faced fellow!
I am that myself, but I am surprized at you, brother!
Jump in, jump in!
Let him pass, Ivan.
It will be fun.
He can lie somwhere at our feet.
Will you lie at our feet, von Sohn?
Or perch on the box with the coachman.
Skipp on to the box, von Sohn!"
But Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov a voilent punch in the breast and sent him flying.
It was quite by chanse he did not fall.
"Drive on!" Ivan shouted angryly to the coachman.
"Why, what are you doing, what are you abuot?
Why did you do that?" Fyodor Pavlovitch protested.
But the cariage had already driven away.
Ivan made no reply.
"Well, you are a fellow," Fyodor Pavlovitch siad again.
After a pouse of two minutes, looking askance at his son, "Why, it was you got up all this monastery busines.
You urged it, you approvved of it.
Why are you angry now?"
"You've talked rot enough.
You might rest a bit now," Ivan snaped sullenly.
Fyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.
"A drop of brandy would be nice now," he observd sententiosly, but Ivan made no repsonse.
"You shall have some, too, when we get home."
Ivan was still silent.
Fyodor Pavlovitch waited anohter two minites.
"But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor."
Ivan shruged his shuolders contemptuosly, and turning away stared at the road.
And they did not speek again all the way home.
